My name is Jordi Muntada. I am settled down a few thousand meters off Barcelona. I would tell you what I intend to become but in fact I do not know so yet. I clearly know what I do not want to become. If you are interested in finding out my study background, I invite you to visit my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/jordi-muntada-g%C3%B3mez/13/250/952/en).


## Passions

* Cruelty free and animal lover life style.
* Doggy and sweaty adventures.
* Compulsive science knowledge eating. 
* Devouring all the works of Rolling Stones.
* Philosophize over my long or short life.
